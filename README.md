# Homemade Soldering Smoke Extractor

## Why

Wanted a cheap soldering smoke extractor with an exit far for the extraction.

## How it looks

_The back side of the extract hole, 2 cooling fans are inside + an active charcoal filter easy to change._

_The front side with the 40mn entry for the air pipe._

![Extract hole front!](/doc/extract_hole_2.jpg "Extract hole front")
_The front side of hole extractor, note that it is easy to move on your soldering plate. Yes the yellow don't looks good but I had no other color left._

_You need to put some weight within the extract hole, may be one day I will find something nicer that this old dirty big screws_


## Materials need

- kind of 40mm diameter air pipe (got mine from dump by my father in law).
- one or two 12cmx12xm PC cooling fans  [AliExpress Link](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000561653138.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- 13cmx13cm active charcoal filter [AliExpress Link](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005002610823724.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- lead or heavy iron 

## How to print

Use the STL in the `stl` folder.

Print on the larger blow hole, no support should be needed.

Prefer a raft for build plate adhesion.

It's a big piece and no precision is needed, you can go Coarse (0.4mm).
